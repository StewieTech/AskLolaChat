# AskLolaChat

### Components
#### Common
- Button
- Input
- ProUpgradeModal
- Login Success
- RegistrationSuccess

Need to think do I need Login/Registration or can I combine them into Modal?


#### Features
##### Authentication
- Login.js
- RegistrationForm.js
- GoogleOAuth.js
- AuthContext.js

My assumption is I won't need Login here and within pages as well, I can probably do one or the other
##### Dashboard
- NavigationMenu
- Header

Header will be an X that turns into navigation menu

##### Image
- ImageDisplayComponent
- ImageUploader

##### Messages
- QuestionCount.js
- TextAreaComonent.js

##### Notifications




### Pages
- MainChatPage.js
- LoginPage.js
- Registration.js
- NavigationMenu.js 
- InterviewPage

- The user should start on the HomePage and then from their the signup automatically starts
- I also want a way to immediately get them to become a pro user
- the first message Lola responds to them with should be free and over the top excited
- CSS pages should accompany files ? I think this is an easier way to manage them to know where they are impacting
